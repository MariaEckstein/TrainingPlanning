# TrainingPlanning

These are scripts I wrote to analyze data from the famous and much-used 2-step decision task (Daw et al.).
MAIN.m is the main script. You can controll everything from there.

This is what you can do with the script:
- You can RUN SIMULATIONS using different models, for example 'mb' (model-based), 'mf' (model-free), and 'hyb' (hybrid model-based and model-free).
- You can ANALYZE THESE SIMULATIONS using different models, for example 'mb', 'mf', and 'hyb', but also other models, such as '1a1b', where alpha1 == alpha2 and beta1 == beta2
- You can also ANALYZE DATA FROM HUMAN PARTICIPANTS, using the same code, and using the same models (plus others you define).
